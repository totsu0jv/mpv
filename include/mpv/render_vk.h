/**
 * Vulkan backend
 * --------------
 *
 * This header contains definitions for using Vulkan with the render.h API.
 *
 * Vulkan interop
 * --------------
 *
 * The user owns the VkInstance, VkDevice, and queues. mpv imports the device
 * using libplacebo's pl_vulkan_import(). The user provides a VkImage per frame
 * for mpv to render into.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - Vulkan 1.3 or higher
 * - Device must have timeline semaphore support
 * - User must enable required extensions when creating the device (see below)
 *
 * Required device extensions (user must enable these):
 * - VK_KHR_timeline_semaphore (core in 1.2+)
 * - VK_KHR_external_memory (for hwdec interop)
 *
 * Recommended device extensions:
 * - VK_KHR_video_decode_queue (for Vulkan video decode hwdec)
 * - VK_KHR_video_decode_h264
 * - VK_KHR_video_decode_h265
 *
 * Synchronization
 * ---------------
 *
 * The user provides binary or timeline semaphores for synchronization:
 * - wait_semaphore: mpv waits on this before rendering (user signals when
 *   the target image is ready to be written)
 * - signal_semaphore: mpv signals this after rendering completes (user waits
 *   on this before presenting or using the image)
 *
 * If semaphores are not provided (NULL), mpv will use pl_gpu_finish() which
 * is less efficient but simpler.
 *
 * Hardware decoding
 * -----------------
 *
 * For Vulkan hwdec to work, the user must:
 * - Provide MPV_RENDER_PARAM_WL_DISPLAY (Wayland) for dmabuf import
 * - Enable the appropriate video decode extensions on the device
 * - Ensure the device supports VK_QUEUE_VIDEO_DECODE_BIT_KHR
